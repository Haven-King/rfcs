# Summary

This RFC describes plugins for the Quilt mod loader, and aims to describe the
purpose(s), functionality, and implications of such a system. At a high level,
loader plugins will allow developers to control the mod loading process itself,
giving them access to powerful tools for defining, loading, and removing mods.


# Motivation

One of the most common barriers of entry for new mod users is having to download
and install APIs and libraries in addition to the mods they want to use. Adding a
way for Quilt Loader to fetch dependencies dynamically will help ease this
headache and make Quilt a more appealing option for new mod users. Plugins will
allow us to add such behavior dynamically when required, while allowing the
behavior to be disabled if a user does not want or need it.

Plugins will allow third-party libraries to define complex mod resolution behavior
such as [allowing mods to declare "API" classes that other mods can declare implementations for](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader/issues/343).

Projects such as [PatchworkMC](https://patchworkmc.net/) and [Sponge](https://www.spongepowered.org/) will be able to run non-Quilt mods ([Forge](https://forums.minecraftforge.net/) and Sponge mods, respectively) on top of the Quilt platform by
performing transformations during the mod loading process.

Once CHASM is implemented as a universal standard for bytecode transformations
across Quilt, this system will allow us to remove the special case code for Mixin
and access wideners and reimplement those as loader plugins instead. This will make
developing third-party libraries that modify bytecode in unique and interesting
ways possible.

Loader plugins could also be used to [add mod containers for mods that don't do anything](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader/issues/175), although a
better system for that will likely be implemented separately into Loader itself.

A loader plugin could be developed to load mods from instance-specific folders instead of the single shared mods folder.

By breaking parts of the mod loading process into various projects, we can keep
each repository focused on its own specific mission. This will allow for more
finely grained separation of responsibility.


# Explanation

The addition of Quilt Loader plugins will make Quilt Loader a plugin loader, not
a traditional mod loader. Much of the existing mod loading behavior will be
moved to one or more first-party loader plugins that are installed by default,
keeping only the bare minimum amount of code required for mod resolving in Loader
proper. Loader plugins will be capable of effecting the mod loading process by
adding mods and even adding other plugins. Plugins will also have the ability to
open/create UI elements which can be used for as simple a thing as prompting the
user for confirmation, or as complex of one as writing a full-scale mod launcher
as a loader plugin.

## Application
Loader plugins are initially added from the classpath, allowing default loader
plugins for an instance to be added via the profile json. All plugins are then
applied in cycles. During each cycle, the following things happen:
- Each plugin is given a chance to add any plugin candidates
    - Each new plugin added this way is given a chance to add any plugin candidates.
      Rinse and repeat.
- Each plugin is given a chance to add any required or tentative mod candidates,
  rules, or options
- Quilt Loader will evaluate the sat4j tree
    - Each plugin will be given a chance to claim unsatisfied rules for resolution
    - Each plugins resolvers will be run sequentially

If any changes to the mod set have taken place during a given cycle, another cycle
will be run. Otherwise, the game will either launch or crash, depending on whether
or not all rules have been satisfied.


## API Surface

Below is a tentative plan of what the surface level API classes might look like.
Everything here is subject (and likely) to change, but helps provide a visual
idea of how developers might use this feature down the road.

# Drawbacks

All existing behavior can be implemented using loader plugins. As such, the largest
drawback may be the increased scope for the Quilt project as a whole, as we will no
longer be limited to mods specifically. This is less of a drawback and more of an
organizational change that needs to be considered moving forward.

Another drawback is the potential confusion of end users that may stem from a more
complicated mod loading process. If a plugin fails to provide a required mod which
therefore causes a crash, it's possible that users may receive error messages that
further confuse them rather than cause clarity. Careful consideration will have to
be put into the development of Quilt's official loader plugins to ensure that each
of our loader plugins emits thorough and helpful error messages upon failure.


# Rationale and Alternatives

While we could continue with the current status quo of loading mods from the mods
folder and only the mods folder, this is a rigid and outdated way of doing so that
does not allow for iteration and innovation.

If loader plugins are not implemented, we would have a very hard time
differentiating ourselves from other mod loaders. Plugins will allow both us and
the community itself to add features to Quilt loader easily, making it much easier
for innovation in where mods come from and how they are loaded.


# Prior Art

If this has been done before by some other project, explain it here. This could
be positive or negative. Discuss what worked well for them and what didn't.

Similar projects have been looked at by others in the past:
- FabLabs very briefly explored this concept [here](https://github.com/FabLabsMC/fabric-loader/tree/feature/modproviders).
- [@Chocohead](https://github.com/Chocohead) has implemented [loading extra mods alongside Fabric Loader](https://github.com/Chocohead/Modjam/blob/master/src/com/chocohead/sm/loader/PreLoader.java), but not as actual Fabric mods.

None of them have been implemented into the mod loader itself, and as such this is
the first project to allow such liberal changes to the mod loading process.


# Unresolved Questions

Before loader plugins can be considered fully implemented, CHASM will need to be
functional so that all bytecode modifications can go through a single source of
truth.

For the purposes of this RFC, I did not go into the drawbacks of
dependency downloading specifically, as this RFC is interested more generally
in the idea of loader plugins as a whole. How dependency downloading is implemented
and other concerns regarding that will take place at a later date, in another RFC.


# Expected Response

Loader plugins have been one of the earliest features Quilt promised to deliver. As
such, I expect the community will largely be excited to see this feature
implemented. Projects such as [Bundle Installer](https://github.com/FoundationGames/Bundle-Installer) will be able to make use of loader plugins right from day one, and
I expect that we'll see a lot of similar projects that aim to make the mod
installation process as easy as possible for end users.
